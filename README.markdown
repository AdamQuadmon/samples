Angular Sample Applications
===========================

[angular]: http://getangular.com/ "angular"

These are sample applications for [angular][angular].

You can get started with them in a few simple steps:

1.  Sign up for an account at [angular][angular]
2.  Create a library, and create a database within that library called **samples**
3.  Clone or fork this project

Now you can explore the samples. Try modifying them, then try building your own angular application.

You can run the samples from the filesystem, or use [rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/).
